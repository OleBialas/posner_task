# Posner

This is an implementation of the Posner attention cueing task [^1] implemented using the Psychopy software package.

## Installation
Because Psychopy has a lot of dependencies, it is recommended to install the package into a new environment using Python version 3.8 (this package does not require a specific version but Psychopy is does).
The experiment can be installed using `pip`

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/OleBialas/posner_task.git
```

## Run experiment
